## About the Collection
The Philippine Documentary Heritage Archival Collection on the COVID-19 Pandemic or PHDH is a non-profit initiative that aims to set up a digital repository of creative works and experiences of Philippine artists and cultural workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Through your invaluable contributions to the digital repository, we hope to piece together the extent and ways the pandemic impacted the creative sector. 

The PHDH was initiated by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts - National Committee on Archives (NCCA-NCA), with the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) as the proponent. Our aim is to make the PHDH digital repository publicly accessible as references for artists, researchers, programmers, and policymakers, among others. With your help, we will be able to collectively surface the most immediate and pressing challenges imposed by the COVID-19 crisis.
